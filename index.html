              The four most critical pieces of infrastructure that make the
              Internet work -- Bind, Perl, sendmail and Apache -- every one of
              these is open source, every one of these is super reliable. The
              Internet would not function if they weren't super reliable, and
              they're super reliable precisely because throughout their entire
              history people have been constantly banging on the code, looking
              at the source, seeing what breaks and fixing it.

              price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in
              “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”
